# Railway Deployment Guide for Appliance-Watch

This guide will help you deploy the Appliance-Watch application to Railway, a modern deployment platform.

## Prerequisites

- A Railway account (sign up at https://railway.app)
- A Supabase account and active project (sign up at https://supabase.com)
- Git repository with your code
- Basic knowledge of environment variables

## Important: Database Configuration

**This project uses Supabase as the database provider**, not Railway's built-in PostgreSQL. Make sure you have:
- An active Supabase project
- Your Supabase database connection string ready
- Supabase project accessible from external services (default setting)

## Project Structure

This project consists of two main parts:
- **Frontend**: React/Vite application (root directory)
- **Backend**: Express.js/TypeScript API (backend directory)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Create Railway Account and Project

1. Sign up at https://railway.app
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Create a new project from your GitHub repository

### 2. Configure Supabase Database

1. Make sure your Supabase project is set up and running
2. Get your Supabase database connection string from your Supabase dashboard
3. Navigate to Settings â†’ Database in your Supabase project
4. Copy the connection string (it should look like: `postgresql://postgres:[password]@[host]:5432/postgres`)
5. Note: You'll use this DATABASE_URL for both development and production

### 3. Deploy Backend Service

1. Click "Add Service" â†’ "GitHub Repo"
2. Select your repository
3. Set the **Root Directory** to `backend`
4. Configure environment variables:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=<your-supabase-database-url>
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=3002
   FRONTEND_URL=<your-frontend-railway-url>
   CORS_ORIGINS=<your-frontend-railway-url>
   JWT_SECRET=<your-secure-jwt-secret>
   ```
5. Railway will automatically build and deploy your backend

**Note**: Since you're using Supabase, Railway won't provision a database service. Make sure your Supabase database is accessible from Railway's servers.

### 4. Deploy Frontend Service

1. Click "Add Service" â†’ "GitHub Repo"
2. Select your repository again
3. Leave **Root Directory** empty (root of project)
4. Configure environment variables:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=<your-backend-railway-url>/api
   ```
5. Railway will automatically build and deploy your frontend

### 5. Configure Custom Domains (Optional)

1. Go to each service settings
2. Click "Domains" tab
3. Add custom domain or use Railway-provided domain

## Environment Variables Reference

### Backend (.env)
```bash
# Database Configuration - Your Supabase Database URL
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:[password]@[host]:5432/postgres

# Server Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3002

# Frontend Configuration
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-url.railway.app

# CORS origins (comma-separated)
CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-url.railway.app,https://your-domain.com

# JWT Settings
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret-here
```

### Frontend (.env)
```bash
# API Configuration
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app/api
```

## Build Commands

Railway will automatically detect and run these commands:

### Backend
- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Start**: `npm run start:production`

### Frontend
- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Start**: `npm run start:production`

## Database Setup

Since you're using **Supabase** as your database provider:

1. **No Railway database service needed** - Skip adding PostgreSQL in Railway
2. **Supabase Connection**: Use your existing Supabase database URL
3. **Automatic Schema Migration**: The backend will automatically:
   - Run TypeScript compilation (`npm run build`)
   - Push database schema to Supabase (`npm run db:migrate`)
   - Start the server (`npm run start`)
4. **Network Access**: Supabase is accessible from Railway by default
5. **Connection Pooling**: Supabase handles connection pooling automatically

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Conflicts**: Railway automatically assigns ports. Make sure your backend uses `process.env.PORT`

3. **Database Connection Issues**: 
   - Verify `DATABASE_URL` points to your Supabase database
   - Check Supabase project status in your Supabase dashboard
   - Ensure your Supabase project allows external connections
   - Verify the connection string format: `postgresql://postgres:[password]@[host]:5432/postgres`

4. **CORS Issues**: 
   - Update `CORS_ORIGINS` with your actual Railway URLs
   - Ensure frontend URL is correct

5. **Build Failures**:
   - Check build logs in Railway dashboard
   - Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`

### Logs and Monitoring

- View logs in Railway dashboard under each service
- Use Railway CLI for advanced debugging: `railway logs`

## Production Considerations

1. **Security**: Always use strong JWT secrets in production
2. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files to version control
3. **Database Backups**: Railway provides automatic backups
4. **Monitoring**: Set up health checks and monitoring

## Railway CLI (Optional)

Install Railway CLI for advanced management:
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway link
```
